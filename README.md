# Description


Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is a web-based application that enables multiple users to collaboratively edit documents in real time, similar to Google Docs.

It combines the power of modern JavaScript frameworks and real-time technologies to create a seamless editing experience, where changes made by one user are instantly reflected across all connected clients.

The core idea is to provide a fast, reliable, and interactive text editor for teams, students, writers, or businesses who need to work together on documents without version conflicts or delays. 

Whether you're co-authoring an article, taking group notes, or writing code documentation, this editor keeps everyone on the same pageâ€”literally.
